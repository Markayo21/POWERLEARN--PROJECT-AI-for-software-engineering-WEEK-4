# 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

This section explores key concepts behind AI tools used in software engineering, focusing on efficiency, learning approaches, and ethical considerations.

## ❓ Q1: How do AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time? What are their limitations?

**Answer:**

AI-driven code generation tools like GitHub Copilot significantly accelerate development by auto-suggesting code snippets, completing functions, and even generating full boilerplate code based on comments. This reduces the time spent typing repetitive logic, improves productivity, and helps beginners learn by example.

However, these tools also have **limitations**:
- They may suggest **insecure**, **inefficient**, or **deprecated** code.
- They lack full understanding of project context or business logic.
- Over-reliance can result in **shallow understanding** for junior developers.
- Generated code might inadvertently reproduce **biased** or **plagiarized** logic from training data.

In summary, Copilot is a great assistant, but it should be used thoughtfully alongside human review and testing.

---

## ❓ Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

**Answer:**

- **Supervised learning** uses labeled datasets (e.g., code labeled as "bug" or "no bug"). It is ideal for identifying known bug patterns. Models learn from past examples to classify new code accurately.

  *Example*: A classifier trained on labeled buggy commits can flag similar bugs in new code.

- **Unsupervised learning** deals with **unlabeled** data. It finds hidden patterns or anomalies.

  *Example*: Clustering or anomaly detection can identify unexpected behaviors or code segments that differ from normal patterns — potential bugs that were not previously labeled.

**Key Difference**:
- Supervised = detection of **known** bugs with higher precision.
- Unsupervised = discovery of **unknown or rare** bugs.

Both can be combined in hybrid systems to improve bug detection coverage.

## ❓ Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

**Answer:**

Bias mitigation is essential to ensure **fairness**, **inclusivity**, and **user trust** when personalizing software experiences. AI systems can unintentionally favor certain demographics, interests, or behavior patterns, especially if the training data is imbalanced or reflects historical prejudices.

For example:
- A recommender system might suggest different features to users based on **gender** or **location**, reinforcing stereotypes.
- Personalization engines could under-represent minority users’ needs.

If left unchecked, this can lead to:
- **Unfair treatment** of users.
- **Loss of user engagement**.
- **Legal and ethical concerns**, especially in regulated domains.

**Bias mitigation techniques** like fairness-aware algorithms, diverse training data, and continuous monitoring are crucial to make personalization **equitable and responsible**.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)
# 🧠 Task 1- AI-Powered Code Completion 

## 🎯 Task Objective

Use **GitHub Copilot** to generate a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a given key. Then manually write your own version of the function, compare both approaches, and reflect on their performance and learning value.

---

## 📄 Task Description

Given a list of student dictionaries:

```python
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 91},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 85},
    {"name": "Charlie", "score": 78}
]

# AI-Suggested Function (GitHub Copilot)
python
Copy
Edit
def sort_dict_list_by_key(data, key):
    return sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[key])
✅ Explanation:
sorted() is a Python built-in function.

key=lambda x: x[key] tells Python how to sort: by dictionary value at the given key.

# Manually Written Function (Beginner-Friendly)
python
Copy
Edit
def sort_dict_list_by_key(data, key):
    for i in range(len(data)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(data)):
            if data[i][key] > data[j][key]:
                data[i], data[j] = data[j], data[i]
    return data
# 📝 Explanation:
This is a simple version of bubble sort.

It compares and swaps items if they are out of order.

🔬 Output Comparison

students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 91},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 85},
    {"name": "Charlie", "score": 78}
]
```
# Copilot version
print("AI version:", sort_dict_list_by_key(students, "score"))

# Manual version
print("Manual:", sort_dict_list_by_key(students, "score"))

## 📊 200-Word Comparison – Copilot vs Manual
In this task, I used GitHub Copilot to generate a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a given key. Copilot suggested a very concise and efficient implementation using Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda function. The code was just one line and very readable.

In contrast, I manually wrote a version using nested loops, similar to a bubble sort. While this helped me understand sorting better, it was longer, less efficient, and more prone to bugs.

The AI-generated code is better for real-world projects because it is optimized (Python uses Timsort internally), easier to read, and less error-prone. It also took much less time to write using Copilot.

However, writing the manual version was still helpful for learning. It showed me how sorting works under the hood and deepened my understanding.

In conclusion, AI tools like GitHub Copilot are powerful for boosting productivity and writing clean code quickly. But manual coding builds core skills. The best approach is using both together: rely on AI for speed, but understand the logic for mastery.

# 🧩 Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

## 🧠 Prompt:
Your predictive model from Task 3 is deployed in a company. Discuss:

- Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams).
- How fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.

---

### ⚠️ Potential Dataset Biases

When deploying a predictive model (e.g., using the Breast Cancer Dataset) in a real-world company setting, **data bias** is a serious concern.

Some common forms of bias include:

- **Underrepresented groups or teams**: If some teams or departments have fewer entries in the dataset, the model might learn skewed patterns.
- **Label imbalance**: If one class (e.g., "low priority" vs. "high priority") dominates, the model may over-predict that class.
- **Historical discrimination**: If past decisions were biased (e.g., high-priority tags favored senior teams), the model may replicate and reinforce this.

These biases can lead to **unfair resource allocation**, **loss of trust**, or **discriminatory outcomes** in automated decisions.

---

### 🛠️ Mitigating Bias with AI Fairness Tools

**IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)** is an open-source toolkit designed to detect and reduce bias in AI models.

Here’s how it helps:

- **Bias Detection**: AIF360 provides metrics to evaluate fairness across groups (e.g., disparate impact, equal opportunity).
- **Bias Mitigation**: It includes pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques to reduce unfair outcomes.
- **Transparency**: It creates traceable, explainable models for better accountability.

By integrating tools like AIF360 into the ML pipeline, companies can ensure their predictive models are **more inclusive, accountable, and ethically aligned** with fairness standards.
